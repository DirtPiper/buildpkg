===========
What is it?
===========
buildpkg is a collection of bourne shell script code that implements a
framework for easy scripting a package build for IRIX or Solaris in
a repeatable manner.

Anyone familiar with how an rpm specfile works will see the similarities
but basically it works on the premise that everything is built into a
staging area and metadata describing the final package layout is used to
automatically generate the necessary metadata for the native packageformat.
By design it is not possible to hand-tweak the generated metadata as it is
always regenerated, any tweaks must be implemented through metadata in the
buildsystem.

Dependencies are automatically extracted from files in the stagedir
(filtering is possible) and it's also possible to manually add hidden
dependencies that cannot be extracted automatically.

There's also steps that automcatically compiles manpages and compresses them.
It can handle symlinked manpages and even manpages that are just links to other
manpages (ie. using the nroff .so command).
